/**
 * GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource (rewritten to /api/oauth-protected-resource)
 *
 * RFC 9728 OAuth Protected Resource Metadata, served dynamically so every
 * host that terminates the request (apex megabrain.market, www, or
 * api.megabrain.market) returns self-consistent `resource` +
 * `authorization_servers` pointing at itself.
 *
 * Why dynamic: scanners like isitagentready.com (and Cloudflare's reference
 * at mcp.cloudflare.com) enforce that `authorization_servers[*]` share
 * origin with `resource`. A single static file served from 3 hosts can only
 * satisfy one origin at a time; deriving both fields from the request Host
 * header makes the response correct regardless of which host is scanned.
 *
 * RFC 9728 §3 permits split origins, but the scanner is stricter — and
 * same-origin by construction is simpler than arguing with scanner authors.
 *
 * The Host is client-controlled, so the origin is derived through
 * `resolveMetadataOrigin` (apex + subdomain allowlist, apex fallback) so a
 * spoofed Host cannot be reflected into `resource`/`authorization_servers`.
