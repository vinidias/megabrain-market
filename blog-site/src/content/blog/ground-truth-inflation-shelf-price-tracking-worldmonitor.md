Official inflation is a lagging average of an averaged lag. A national CPI print arrives weeks after the month it measures, blends thousands of items into one number, and tells you nothing about whether *your* basket at *your* store got more expensive on Tuesday.

The interesting question — what do things actually cost, right now, on the shelf? — has a different answer. You collect the prices yourself. That's what MegaBrainMarket's consumer-prices system does.

## Shelf prices, scraped daily

The pilot market is the **United Arab Emirates**, where MegaBrainMarket tracks a defined essentials basket across **four major grocery retailers: Carrefour, Spinneys, Lulu, and Noon**. Real product pages, real listed prices — collected continuously and normalized into a comparable basket.

From that raw feed, the Consumer Prices panel serves:

- a **30-day overview** of basket-level price movement,
- **category inflation** — which aisles are moving, not just whether "food" is up,
- **retailer spread** — the same essentials basket priced across all four chains, which is both a shopping tool and a market-structure measurement,
- **top movers** — the specific items repricing fastest,
- and a **freshness readout**, because a price feed that hides its own staleness is just CPI with better marketing.

Basket definitions for additional countries — the US, UK, Australia, India, Brazil, Singapore, Switzerland, Kenya, and more — are already staged in the pipeline, waiting on live retailer coverage. The UAE proves the model; the roadmap is geographic.

## The context instruments

Shelf-price truth is most useful next to its slower official cousins, so the platform keeps them adjacent:

- **IMF WEO official CPI** for ~195 countries — the world-inflation reference layer.
- The **Big Mac Index** — the classic purchasing-power shorthand.
- The **FAO Food Price Index** — global food-commodity pressure upstream of your grocery store.
- **Retail fuel prices** — the other price everyone feels weekly.

Read them as a chain: FAO tells you global food inputs are rising; tariff and freight data tells you the [transmission path](/blog/posts/tracking-global-trade-routes-chokepoints-freight-costs/) is stressed; shelf prices tell you the exact week it reached the checkout. That last link is the one official statistics can't give you.

## For developers and agents

The `get_consumer_prices` MCP tool (UAE today) returns the overview, category inflation, retailer spread, and movers in one structured call; the consumer-prices REST endpoints expose the same series, and `get_tariff_trends` adds the Big Mac, FAO, and fiscal context. For [macro traders](/blog/posts/geopolitics-to-markets-pipeline-macro-traders-megabrain-market/), shelf-price velocity is an inflation nowcast; for journalists, "bread rose 11% across four chains in three weeks" is a story with receipts.

## Limits

Coverage is honest about being narrow: one country live, four retailers, an essentials basket — a precise instrument, not yet a global one. Scraped prices reflect listed shelf prices, not loyalty discounts or in-store promotions. And a retailer basket is deliberately not a CPI replacement: it trades statistical breadth for speed and specificity. Use both — that's why both are on the dashboard.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Which countries have live shelf-price tracking?**

The UAE, across Carrefour, Spinneys, Lulu, and Noon. Basket configurations for the US, UK, Australia, India, Brazil, Singapore, Switzerland, Kenya, and others are staged for expansion. Official IMF CPI context covers ~195 countries today.

**How is this different from official inflation statistics?**

Official CPI is broad, methodologically rigorous, and weeks delayed. Shelf-price tracking is narrow, literal, and current — actual listed prices for a fixed basket, updated continuously with freshness reported.

**Can I query the price data programmatically?**

Yes — the `get_consumer_prices` MCP tool and the consumer-prices REST endpoints in the [API reference](https://www.megabrain.market/docs/api-reference) return the overview, categories, movers, and retailer spread as structured series.

**Inflation isn't a monthly press release — it's this week's shelf tag. Measure the shelf, keep the official number for context, and you'll know before the statistics do.**
