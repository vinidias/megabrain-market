# Dependency audit follow-up - 2026-06-02

Scope: Country Resilience Index round-4 P3-2 dependency hygiene follow-up, with round-5 R5-3 stale-count correction. This note records package-audit reachability only; no resilience scorer/runtime code was changed.

## Commands

- Baseline before lockfile refresh:
  - `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 36 moderate.
  - `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 9 high, 44 moderate.
- After lockfile refresh, rerun on 2026-06-02 with `node v26.0.0` and `npm 11.12.1` in this worktree:
  - Root `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 36 moderate.
  - Root `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 43 moderate.
  - `blog-site/` `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 vulnerabilities.

Counting caveat: npm audit totals are metadata counts for vulnerable package nodes in the resolved dependency graph, not unique CVE/GHSA advisory counts. npm 11's current graph counting reports 36 production moderate nodes and 43 all-dependency moderate nodes here; earlier 18/20 post-refresh totals in this note were stale.

## Updated dev/build chain

The high advisories were dev/build-only and were removed with a package-lock-only refresh inside existing semver ranges:

- `vite-plugin-pwa`: 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0.
- `workbox-build` and Workbox packages: 7.4.0 -> 7.4.1.
- Babel Workbox build chain, including `@babel/plugin-transform-modules-systemjs`: 7.29.7.
- `ajv`: 8.20.0.
- `fast-uri`: 3.1.2.
- Workbox `brace-expansion`: 5.0.6.
- `tmp`: 0.2.7.
- npm 10 lockfile peer entries for `utf-8-validate`: 5.0.10.

This clears the prior all-dependency high advisories in the PWA/Workbox/AJV/Babel chain and the `exceljs -> tmp` high advisory. `exceljs` remains at 4.4.0, which is the latest published version at the time of this audit.

## Remaining production-runtime advisories

Production audit remains high/critical clean. Remaining production advisories are moderate and are in these reachable dependency families:

- `@anthropic-ai/sdk`: direct dependency; npm reports no compatible fix available.
- Clerk wallet stack: `@clerk/clerk-js` through Solana wallet adapters, `@solana/web3.js`, `viem`, `ws`, `jayson`, and `uuid`.
- Mapping/vector stack: `deck.gl`, `@deck.gl/geo-layers`, `maplibre-gl`, `pbf`, `resolve-protobuf-schema`, and `protocol-buffers-schema`.
- Convex stack: `@dodopayments/convex`, `convex`, and `ws`.
- Telegram proxy/address parser stack: `telegram`, `socks`, and `ip-address`.
- Shared websocket/identifier transitives: `ws`, `uuid`, `isows`, and `isomorphic-ws`.

These were not force-upgraded because npm does not offer high/critical production fixes in the current compatible graph, and forcing broad wallet/map/runtime upgrades would be outside this P3 dependency-hygiene scope.

## Remaining dev/build-only advisories

The all-dependency audit now has only moderate dev/build advisories on top of the production-runtime moderate set:

- `vite`, `vite-plugin-pwa`, `vitest`, and `@vitest/mocker` through `postcss <8.5.10`. The root `vite@6.4.2` range currently resolves `postcss@8.5.8`; npm reports no compatible fix without broader Vite/PostCSS movement.
- `convex-test` through the same Convex/ws chain reported in production.
- `exceljs -> uuid@8.3.2`. `exceljs@4.4.0` depends on `uuid@^8.3.0`; no newer ExcelJS release is available, and replacing the spreadsheet library is outside this narrow follow-up.

No force upgrade was applied because the remaining issues are moderate and would require broader package replacement or runtime/toolchain changes.

## Round 6 R6-3 wallet-chain check - 2026-06-03

Scope: Country Resilience Index round-6 R6-3 moderate dependency advisory debt in the Clerk/Solana wallet chain.

Current audit results in the `origin/main` worktree at `e1739afc4758e664d13aae54e1b457c12e5eb075`:

- `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 12 moderate.
- `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 13 moderate.

These counts are lower than the earlier round-4 refresh because this section is a fresh point-in-time audit of the current `origin/main` tree, not a reduction produced by this R6-3 pass. npm's current report no longer includes the earlier Anthropic SDK, mapping/vector, Convex, Telegram, or shared websocket advisory families in this lockfile; the remaining production findings are the Clerk wallet chain.

The production findings are the Clerk wallet chain:

- `@clerk/clerk-js@6.13.0` directly pins `@solana/wallet-adapter-base@0.9.27`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react@0.15.39`, and `@solana/wallet-standard@1.1.4`.
- The Solana wallet packages peer on `@solana/web3.js@^1.98.0`; the resolved and latest stable release is `@solana/web3.js@1.98.4`.
- `@solana/web3.js@1.98.4` depends on `jayson@^4.1.1`; the resolved and latest release is `jayson@4.3.0`.
- `jayson@4.3.0` depends on `uuid@^8.3.2`, which remains inside the `uuid <11.1.1` advisory range.

The all-dependency-only extra finding is `exceljs@4.4.0 -> uuid@^8.3.0`. `exceljs@4.4.0` is still the latest published release.

A targeted package-lock-only update attempt was run for the implicated packages:

`npm update @clerk/clerk-js @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-standard @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-react @solana/web3.js jayson uuid exceljs --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`

npm reported the graph was up to date and still had 13 moderate findings. It only removed optional peer lockfile entries for `utf-8-validate`, which did not reduce R6-3, so that incidental lockfile churn was not kept.

No override was added. Forcing `uuid@>=11.1.1` under `jayson` or `exceljs` would violate their declared `uuid@^8` ranges, and forcing `@solana/web3.js@2.x` or `3.x` would violate the current wallet adapter peer range and would be a broader wallet integration migration. Clerk snapshot/canary builds newer than `6.13.0` still pin the same Solana wallet packages.

Recommended tracking action: keep R6-3 open as upstream dependency debt and retest when one of these stable releases exists: Clerk removes or updates the Solana wallet pins, Solana wallet adapters accept a patched `@solana/web3.js` line, `@solana/web3.js` 1.x stops depending on `jayson -> uuid@8`, or `jayson`/`exceljs` publish compatible `uuid@>=11.1.1` support.

## Round 7 R7-2 dependency-envelope check - 2026-06-03

Scope: Country Resilience audit round-7 R7-2 moderate advisory debt in the broader repo dependency envelope. This pass stayed limited to root dependency audit evidence and did not change frontend import or bundle architecture.

Current audit results in the `origin/main` worktree at `14fd4a5f6d26b36c5ac8289af5073c092d5a2b4d`:

- `npm audit --omit=dev --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 12 moderate.
- `npm audit --json`: 0 critical, 0 high, 13 moderate.

The before and after counts are unchanged for this R7-2 pass because the compatible graph is already at the latest stable releases for the implicated packages:

- `@clerk/clerk-js@6.13.0` is the latest stable release and still directly depends on `@solana/wallet-adapter-base@0.9.27`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react@0.15.39`, and `@solana/wallet-standard@1.1.4`.
- `@solana/web3.js@1.98.4` is the latest stable 1.x release and still depends on `jayson@^4.1.1`.
- `jayson@4.3.0` is the latest release and still depends on `uuid@^8.3.2`.
- `exceljs@4.4.0` is the latest release and still depends on `uuid@^8.3.0`.

Commands run for this check:

- `npm audit --omit=dev --json`
- `npm audit --json`
- `npm_config_cache=/tmp/worldmonitor-npm-cache npm audit fix --package-lock-only --dry-run --json`
- `npm_config_cache=/tmp/worldmonitor-npm-cache npm update @clerk/clerk-js @solana/wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-adapter-react @solana/wallet-standard @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-base @solana/wallet-standard-wallet-adapter-react @solana/web3.js jayson uuid exceljs --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`

The targeted update reported the graph was up to date and still had 13 moderate findings. It produced only incidental optional-peer lockfile churn for `utf-8-validate`; that churn did not affect the audit result and was not kept.

`npm audit fix --package-lock-only --dry-run --json` reported no safe package-lock-only reduction. Its force-style fix suggestions were semver-major downgrades, not compatible upgrades:

- `@clerk/clerk-js` 6.13.0 -> 5.114.1, which would change the direct auth package major line.
- `exceljs` 4.4.0 -> 3.4.0, which would downgrade the spreadsheet export dependency.

No override was added. Forcing `uuid@>=11.1.1` under `jayson` or `exceljs` would violate their declared `uuid@^8` ranges, and forcing a newer Solana API line would exceed the current wallet-adapter peer envelope. Those changes need auth, wallet, and export compatibility validation beyond this narrow dependency-envelope audit.

Owner/date: dependency hygiene owner, 2026-06-03. Close R7-2 when one of these lands and validates cleanly: Clerk removes or updates the Solana wallet pins, Solana wallet adapters accept a patched Solana web3 line, Solana web3 1.x removes the `jayson -> uuid@8` edge, `jayson` publishes compatible `uuid@>=11.1.1` support, or `exceljs` publishes compatible `uuid@>=11.1.1` support.
