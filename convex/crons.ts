// PRO-launch broadcast ramp runner. Wakes once a day at 13:00 UTC
// (~9am ET / 6am PT / 3pm CET — early enough that any kill-gate
// trip can be triaged within US business hours, late enough that
// overnight bounces and complaints have flowed back via the Resend
// webhook). The action no-ops when no ramp is configured, the ramp
// is paused, kill-gated, or the prior wave hasn't settled yet —
// see `convex/broadcast/rampRunner.ts` for the full state machine.
// Daily retention prune for the plan-limit tables. apiUsageRollups gains a row
// per user per hourly scan and apiPlanLimitNotices accumulates superseded rows,

// duplicates don't break correctness, but they degrade OCC contention
// coverage for users hashing to that shard. Running the dedupe in the
