# Pricing - MegaBrain Market

Last updated: July 6, 2026

MegaBrain Market has a free public dashboard and paid tiers for analyst workflows, API access and organization deployments.

Live tier/price/product-ID data (JSON): `GET https://www.megabrain.market/api/product-catalog` — public, no key required. Send a descriptive `User-Agent` (for example `mytool/1.0 (+https://yoursite.example)`); default HTTP-library user agents may be challenged by the edge firewall.

## Limits & Overage

- Rate limits are hard limits by default: exceeding a plan quota returns HTTP `429` with a `Retry-After` header and `X-RateLimit-*` headers on API responses. Usage above the quota is rejected — never silently charged; if opt-in metered overage is introduced for API plans it will be documented here first.
- Per-endpoint request budgets are documented at https://www.megabrain.market/docs/usage-rate-limits (also fetchable as markdown at https://www.megabrain.market/docs/usage-rate-limits.md).
- Need a higher limit? Upgrade at https://megabrain.market/pro or contact enterprise@megabrain.market for custom quotas.
